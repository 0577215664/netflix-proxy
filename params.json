Works for blocked sites too, such as [PornHub](http://www.pornhub.com/).\r\n\r\nThis solution will only work with devices supporting Server Name Indication (SNI)[n7]. To test, open a web browser on the device you are planning to watch content and go to [this](https://sni.velox.ch/) site (`https://sni.velox.ch/`).\r\n\r\n**Update March/2016**: IPv6 addresses of common hosting providers are now blocked in the same way as IPv4. Netflix seems to be tagging accounts, so if your account is tagged, the only device that will work out of region is the desktop web browser (i.e. Chrome)[n11]. Netflix and BBC iPlayer are both geo-fencing on their media hosts, so the relevant media domains are now proxied by default[n8]. Please note, that proxying media delivery could increase the bandwidth bill you get from your VPS provider. However, since most VPS providers offer 1TB per month inclusive with each server and most home ISPs don't offer anywhere near that amount, it should be a moot point in most situations.\r\n\r\nPlease see the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/wiki) page(s) for some common troubleshooting ideas.\r\n\r\n**Unblocked Netflix?** Great success! [Vote](http://www.poll-maker.com/poll622505x596e406D-26) now and see the [results](http://www.poll-maker.com/results622505xfcC7F6aA-26).\r\n\r\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/static/poll_results.png)](http://www.poll-maker.com/results622505xfcC7F6aA-26)\r\n\r\n# Supported Services\r\nThe following are supported out of the box, however adding additional services is trivial and is done by updating `zones.override` file and running `docker restart bind`:\r\n* Netflix\r\n* Hulu[n2]\r\n* HBO Now \r\n* Amazon Instant Video\r\n* Crackle\r\n* Pandora\r\n* Vudu\r\n* blinkbox\r\n* BBC iPlayer[n5]\r\n* NBC Sports and potentially many [more](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/blob/data/conf/zones.override)\r\n\r\n# Instructions\r\nThe following paragraphs show how to get this solution up and running with a few different Cloud providers I've tried so far.\r\n\r\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/digitalocean.png)](https://m.do.co/c/937b01397c94)\r\n\r\nThe following is based on a standard Ubuntu Docker image provided by `DigitalOcean`, but should in theory work on any Linux distribution **with** Docker pre-installed.\r\n\r\n1. Head over to [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/937b01397c94) to get **$10 USD credit**\r\n2. Create a Droplet using `Docker 1.x` on `Ubuntu 14.04` (find in under `One-click Apps` tab).\r\n3. Create a free [tunnel broker](https://tunnelbroker.net/register.php) account.\r\n4. Create a [regular tunnel](https://tunnelbroker.net/new_tunnel.php)\r\n5. Set the `IPv4 Endpoint` to the Droplet IP, pick a tunnel server in the US and click `Create Tunnel`.\r\n6. Select `Example Configurations` tab, select `Debian/Ubuntu` from the drop-down and copy the tunnel configuration.\r\n7. SSH to your Droplet and add the tunnel configuration to `/etc/network/interfaces` file.\r\n8. Save the file and run: `ifup he-ipv6 && git clone https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy /opt/netflix-proxy && cd /opt/netflix-proxy && ./build.sh`\r\n9. Make sure to record the credentials for the `netflix-proxy` admin site.\r\n10. Set your DNS server to the IP of the Droplet, then go to [this](http://ipinfo.io/) site to make sure your Droplet IP is displayed.\r\n11. Finally, enjoy `Netflix` and others out of region.\r\n12. Enjoy or raise a new [issue](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/issues/new) if something doesn't work quite right (also `#netflix-proxy` on [freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=netflix-proxy)).\r\n\r\n### Authorising Additional IPs\r\nIf you want to share your system with friends and family, you can authorise their home IP address(s) using the `netflix-proxy` admin site, located at `http://<ipaddr>:8080/`, where `ipaddr` is the public IP address of your VPS. Login using `admin` account with the password you recorded during the build, in step 6.\r\n\r\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/static/admin.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/static/admin.png)\r\n\r\n#### Dynamic IPs\r\nYou can also use the `netflix-proxy` admin site to update your IP address, should your ISP assign you a new one (e.g. via DHCP). If your IP address does change, all HTTP/HTTPS requests will automatically be redirected to the admin site on port `8080`. All DNS requests will be redirected to `dnsmasq` instance running on port `5353`. You will most likely need to purge your browser and system DNS caches after this (e.g. `ipconfig /flushdns` and `chrome://net-internals/#dns`) and/or reboot the relevant devices. This mechanism should work on browsers, but will most likely cause errors on other devices, such as Apple TVs and smart TVs. If you Internet stops working all of a sudden, try loading a browser and going to `netflix.com`.\r\n\r\n#### Automatic IP Authorization\r\n**WARNING**: do not do enable this unless you know what you are doing.\r\n\r\nTo enable automatic authorization of every IP that hits your proxy, set `AUTO_AUTH = True` in `auth/settings.py` and run `service netflix-proxy-admin restart`. This setting will effectively authorize any IP hitting your proxy IP with a web browser for the first time, including bots, hackers, spammers, etc. Upon successful authorization, the browser will be redirected to [Google](http://google.com/).\r\n\r\nThe DNS service is configured with recursion turned on by [default](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy#security), so after a successful authorization, anyone can use your VPS in DNS amplification attacks, which will probably put you in breach of contract with the VPS provider. You have been **WARNED**.\r\n\r\n### Security\r\nThe build script automatically configures the system with **DNS recursion turned on**. This has security implications, since it potentially opens your DNS server to a DNS amplification attack, a kind of a [DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). This should not be a concern however, as long as the `iptables` firewall rules configured automatically by the build script for you remain in place. However if you ever decide to turn the firewall off, please be aware of this.\r\n\r\nIf you want to turn DNS recursion off, please be aware that you will need a mechanism to selectively send DNS requests for domains your DNS server knows about (i.e. netflix.com) to your VPS and send all of the other DNS traffic to your local ISP's DNS server. Something like [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) can be used for this and some Internet routers even have it built in. In order to switch DNS recursion off, you will need to build your system using the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy /opt/netflix-proxy && cd /opt/netflix-proxy && ./build.sh -r 0 -b 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Command Line Options\r\nThe following command line options can be optionaly passed to `build.sh` for additional control:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage: ./build.sh [-r 0|1] [-b 0|1] [-c <ip>] [-i 0|1] [-d 0|1] [-t 0|1] [-z 0|1]\r\n        -r      enable (1) or disable (0) DNS recursion (default: 1)\r\n        -b      grab docker images from repository (0) or build locally (1) (default: 0)\r\n        -c      specify client-ip instead of being taken from ssh_connection[n3]\r\n        -i      skip iptables steps\r\n        -d      skip Docker steps\r\n        -t      skip testing steps\r\n        -z      enable caching resolver (default: 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Other Cloud Providers\r\n\r\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/vultr.png)](http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6871746)\r\n\r\nThe following is based on a Debian image provided by `Vultr`, but should in theory work on any Debian distribution.\r\n\r\n1.

Probably a bit more complicated than it should be, but whatever :)\r\n\r\n1. Then, if you are still interested, head over to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) and sign-up for an account.\r\n2. Get [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\r\n3. On your workstation, run `git clone https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness.git /opt/cloud-harness`.\r\n4. Follow `cloud-harness` [Installation and Configuration](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#installation-and-configuration) section to set it up.\r\n5. [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-storage-account-name-must-be-unique-as-it-forms-part-of-the-storage-url-check-with---action-check_storage_account_name_availability) a storage account.\r\n6. [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-a-new-hosted-service-name-must-be-unique-within-cloudappnet-domain-check-with---action-check_storage_account_name_availability) a new hosted service.\r\n7. [Add](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#add-x509-certificate-containing-rsa-public-key-for-ssh-authentication-to-the-hosted-service) a hosted service certificate for SSH public key authentication\r\n8. [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-a-reserved-ip-address-for-the-hosted-service) a reserved ip address.\r\n9. [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-virtual-network) a virtual network.\r\n10. [Create](http://docs.docker.com/engine/articles/https/) Docker certificates and update `[DockerExtension]` section in `cloud-harness.conf`.\r\n11. In `cloud-harness.conf` under `[DockerExtension]` section, set `docker_compose = netflix-proxy.yaml`.\r\n\r\nThen, [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-a-new-linux-virtual-machine-deployment-and-role-with-reserved-ip-ssh-authentication-and-customscript-resource-extensionn3) a `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` virtual machine as follows:\r\n\r\n    ./cloud-harness.py azure --action create_virtual_machine_deployment \\\r\n    --service <your hosted service name> \\\r\n    --deployment <your hosted service name> \\\r\n    --name <your virtual machine name> \\\r\n    --label 'Netflix proxy' \\\r\n    --account <your storage account name> \\\r\n    --blob b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04-LTS-amd64-server-20140414-en-us-30GB \\\r\n    --os Linux \\\r\n    --network VNet1 \\\r\n    --subnet Subnet-1 \\\r\n    --ipaddr <your reserved ipaddr name> \\\r\n    --size Medium \\\r\n    --ssh_auth \\\r\n    --disable_pwd_auth \\\r\n    --verbose\r\n\r\nNext, add the DockerExtension:\r\n\r\n    ./cloud-harness.py azure --action add_resource_extension \\\r\n    --service <your hosted service name> \\\r\n    --deployment <your hosted service name> \\\r\n    --name <your virtual machine name> \\\r\n    --extension DockerExtension \\\r\n    --docker_compose netflix-proxy.yaml \\\r\n    --verbose  \r\n\r\nSet `linux_customscript_name` under `[CustomScriptExtensionForLinux]` in `cloud-harness.conf` to `netflix-proxy.sh` and run:\r\n\r\n    ./cloud-harness.py azure --action add_resource_extension \\\r\n    --service netflix-proxy \\\r\n    --deployment netflix-proxy \\\r\n    --name netflix-proxy \\\r\n    --extension CustomScript \\\r\n    --verbose  \r\n\r\nOnce this part finishes, you should be able to SSH to your VM as `azureuser` using custom public TCP port (not `22`) and test the configuration by running:\r\n\r\n    dig netflix.com @localhost && echo \"GET /\" | openssl s_client -servername netflix.com -connect localhost:443\r\n\r\nLastly, use the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) to add `DNS (UDP)`, `HTTP (TCP)` and `HTTPS (TCP)` endpoints and secure them to your home/work/whatever IPs using the Azure `ACL` feature. This means you don't have to run `iptables` firewall on your VM.\r\n\r\nNow you are all set, set DNS server on your device(s) to your Azure public IP and enjoy `Netflix` and don't forget to turn off IPv6.\r\n\r\n### Automated Tests\r\nI've linked this project with `Travis CI` to automatically test the build. The helper Python script `__testbuild.py` now runs automatically after every commit. This script deploys a test `Droplet` and then runs a serious of tests to verify (a) that both `Docker` containers start; and (b) the `built.sh` script outputs the correct message at the end. The test `Droplet` is destroyed and the end of the run.\r\n\r\nThe `__testbuild.py` script can also be used to programatically deploy `Droplets` from the command line as follows:\r\n\r\n\tpython ./__testbuild.py digitalocean --api_token abcdef0123456789... --fingerprint 'aa:bb:cc:dd:...' --region 'abc1'\r\n\t\r\n* `--api_token abcdef0123456789...` is your `DigitalOCean` API v2 token, which you can generate [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications).\r\n* `--fingerprint aa:bb:cc:dd:...` are your personal SSH key fingerprint(s) quoted and separated by spaces. You can manage your SSH keys [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/security). If you don't specify a fingerprint, it will default to my test one, which means you **won't** be able to SSH into your `Droplet`.\r\n* `--region abc1` is the region where you want the `Droplet` deployed. The default is `nyc3`, but you can use `--list_regions` to see the available choices.\r\n* `--help` parameter will also list all of the available command line options to pass to the script.\r\n\r\nNote, you will need a working `Python 2.7` environment and the modules listed in `requirements.txt` (run `pip install -r requirements.txt`).\r\n\r\n### IPv6 and Docker\r\nThis solution uses IPv6 downstream from the proxy to unblock IPv6 enabled providers, such as Netflix. No IPv6 support on the client is required for this to work, only the VPS must have IPv6 support enabled, although you may also need to turn off IPv6 on your local network (or relevant devices).[n6]\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------+                  +-----------+                 +-----------------+\r\n|          |                  |           |                 |                 |\r\n|  client  | +--------------> |   proxy   | +-------------> |  Netflix, etc.  |\r\n|          |      (ipv4)      |           |      (ipv6)     |                 |\r\n+----------+                  +-----------+                 +-----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen IPv6 public address is present on the host, Docker is configured with public IPv6 support. This is done by dividing the small public IPv6 range allocated to the VPS by two and assigning the second half to the Docker system. Network Discovery Protocol (NDP) proxying is required for this to work, since the VPS allocation is usually too small to be properly routed[n9]. Afterwards, Docker is running in dual-stack mode, with each container having a public IPv6 address. If IPv6 is not enabled, the VPS is built with IPv4 support only.\r\n\r\n#### RamNode\r\nThe exception to the rule is RamNode (and any other provider which uses SolusVM as its VPS provisioning system[n10]). In these cases, even though a `/64` subnet is assigned to the VPS, it isn't routed to the server. Instead, individual addresses must be added in the portal if they are to be used on the host. After speaking with RamNode support, it appears this is a side-effect of MAC address filtering, which prevents IP address theft. This means that even though the subnet can be further divided on the host, only the main IPv6 address bound to `eth0` is ever accessible from the outside and none of the IPv6 addresses on the bridges below can communicate over IPv6 to the outside.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate this behavour, follow these steps:\r\n```\r\nIPV6_SUBNET=<allocated-ipv6-subnet> (e.g. 2604:180:2:abc)\r\nIPV6_ADDR=<allocated-ipv6-addr> (e.g. 2604:180:2:abc::abcd)\r\n\r\n# re-configure eth0\r\nip -6 addr del ${IPV6_ADDR}/64 dev eth0\r\nip -6 addr add ${IPV6_ADDR}/80 dev eth0\r\n\r\n# install Docker\r\napt-get update && apt-get -y install vim dnsutils curl sudo git && curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh\r\n\r\n# update DOCKER_OPTS\r\n# for upstart based systems (e.g. Ubuntu):\r\nprintf \"DOCKER_OPTS='--ipv6 --fixed-cidr-v6=\\\"${IPV6_SUBNET}:1::/80\\\"'\\n\" > /etc/default/docker && \\\r\n  service docker restart\r\n\r\n# -- OR --\r\n\r\n# for systemd based systems (e.g. Debian):\r\n# change \"ExecStart\" in /lib/systemd/system/docker.service to:\r\nExecStart=/usr/bin/docker daemon -H fd:// --ipv6 --fixed-cidr-v6=\"${IPV6_SUBNET}:1::/80\"\r\n\r\nsystemctl daemon-reload && \\\r\n  systemctl docker restart\r\n\r\n\r\n# verify IPv6 configuration inside Docker containers\r\ndocker run -it ubuntu bash -c \"ip -6 addr show dev eth0; ip -6 route show\"\r\n\r\n# test (this will fail)\r\ndocker run -it ubuntu bash -c \"ping6 google.com\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if we NAT all IPv6 traffic from this host using `eth0`, communication will be allowed:\r\n```\r\n# NAT all IPv6 traffic behind eth0\r\nip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0  -j MASQUERADE\r\n\r\n# test (this will succeed)\r\ndocker run -it ubuntu bash -c \"ping6 google.com\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Further Work\r\nThis solution is meant to be a quick and dirty (but functional) method of bypassing geo-restrictions for various services. While it is (at least in theory) called a `smart DNS proxy`, the only `smart` bit is in the `zones.override` file, which tells the system which domains to proxy and which to pass through. You could easilly turn this into a `dumb/transparent DNS proxy`, by replacing the contents of `zones.override` with a simple[n4] statement:\r\n\r\n    zone \".\" {\r\n        type master;\r\n        file \"/data/conf/db.override\";\r\n    };\r\n\r\nThis will in effect proxy every request that ends up on your VPS if you set your VPS IP as your main and only DNS server at home. This will unfortunately invalidate the original purpose of this project. Ideally, what you really want to do, is to have some form of DNS proxy at home, which selectively sends DNS requests to your VPS only for the domains you care about (i.e. netflix.com) and leaves everything else going out to your ISP DNS server(s). [Dnsmasq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq) could be used to achieve this, in combination, perhaps, with a small Linux device like Raspberry Pi or a router which can run OpenWRT.\r\n\r\nThere is a [similar](https://github.com/trick77/dockerflix) project to this, which automates the Dnsmasq configuration.\r\n\r\nIf your client is running OS X, you can skip dnsmasq and simply redirect all DNS requests for e.g. `netflix.com` to your VPS IP by creating a file at `/etc/resolver/netflix.com` with these contents:\r\n\r\n    nameserver xxx.yyy.zzz.ttt\r\n\r\nreplacing `xxx.yyy.zzz.ttt` with your VPS IP, of course.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you have any idea, feel free to fork it and submit your changes back to me.\r\n\r\n### Donate\r\nIf you find this useful, please feel free to make a small donation with [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/belodetech) or Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n| Paypal | Bitcoin |\r\n| ------ | ------- |\r\n|<center>[![](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5UUCDR8YXWERQ)</center>|<center>![91c446adbd54ef84eef1c6c1c723586aa0ba85d7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/bitcoin_qr.png)<br />91c446adbd54ef84eef1c6c1c723586aa0ba85d7</center>|\r\n\r\n[![ab1](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2033996?v=3&s=96)](http://ab77.github.io/)\r\n\r\n#### Footnotes\r\n[n1] https://github.com/dlundquist/sniproxy by Dustin Lundquist `dustin@null-ptr.net`\r\n\r\n[n2] `Hulu` is heavily geo-restricted from most non-residential IP ranges and doesn't support IPv6.\r\n\r\n[n3] You can now specify your home/office/etc. IP manually using `-c <ip>` option to `build.sh`.\r\n\r\n[n4] See, serverfault [post](http://serverfault.com/questions/396958/configure-dns-server-to-return-same-ip-for-all-domains).\r\n\r\n[n5] See, this [issue](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/issues/42#issuecomment-152128091).\r\n\r\n[n6] If you have a working IPv6 stack, then your device may be preferring it over IPv4, see this [issue](https://forums.he.net/index.php?topic=3056).\r\n\r\n[n7] See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication.\r\n\r\n[n8] See, https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/48v03v/netflix_begins_geo_checks_on_cdn/.\r\n\r\n[n9] See, [Using NDP proxying](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/ipv6/).
