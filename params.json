Works for blocked sites too, such as [PornHub](http://www.pornhub.com/).\r\n\r\nThis solution will only work with devices supporting Server Name Indication (SNI)[n7]. To test, open a web browser on the device you are planning to watch content and go to [this](https://sni.velox.ch/) site (`https://sni.velox.ch/`).\r\n\r\n**Update March/2016**: Netflix seems to be testing geo-fencing on their media hosts[n8]. If this is affecting you, add the following block to `/opt/netflix-proxy/data/zones.override` and run `docker restart bind`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nzone \"nflxvideo.net.\" {\r\n    type master;\r\n    file \"/data/db.override\";\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, this will potentially land you with a large bandwidth bill from your VPS provider as all Netflix video will now be running through your VPS.\r\n\r\n**Unblocked Netflix?** Great success!

Head over to [Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/937b01397c94) to get **$10 USD credit**\r\n2. Create a `Droplet` using `Docker 1.x` on `Ubuntu 14.04` (find in under `One-click Apps` tab).\r\n3. **Make sure to enable `IPv6` support**.\r\n4. Make sure you create the `Droplet` in the right region, for example if you want to watch US content, create in the US.\r\n5. SSH to your `Droplet` and run: `git clone https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy /opt/netflix-proxy && cd /opt/netflix-proxy && ./build.sh`\r\n6. Point your DNS at the Droplet IP, then go to [this](http://ipinfo.io/) site to make sure your Droplet IP is displayed.\r\n7. Finally, watch `Netflix` and others out of region.\r\n9. Enjoy or raise a new [issue](https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/issues/new) if something doesn't work quite right (also `#netflix-proxy` on [freenode](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=netflix-proxy)).\r\n\r\n### Authorising Additional IPs\r\nIf you want to share your system with friends and family, you can authorise their home IP address(s) as follows (where `x.x.x.x` is the IP address) by running:\r\n\r\n    sudo iptables -I FRIENDS -s x.x.x.x/32 -j ACCEPT\r\n    iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4 || iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\r\n\r\nTo remove previous authorised IP address, run:\r\n\r\n    sudo iptables -D FRIENDS -s x.x.x.x/32 -j ACCEPT\r\n    iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4 || iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules\r\n\r\nIf you want to do this remotely, I've written a very basic front-end, which you can launch on your VPS as follows:\r\n\r\n    ./auth.py 43867\r\n\r\nThen, navigate to the following address in your browser to manage IP addresses in the `FRIENDS` group:\r\n\r\n    http://<your-vps-public-ip>:43867/auth\r\n\r\nPlease note, this is a very basic implementation, which is completely unsecured (which means YOU SHOULD NOT RUN IT, APART FROM WHEN TESTING). To run it in a sensible way, you would need to host it behind a proper web server with at least basic authentication and over SSL, see [web.py install guide](http://webpy.org/install) for more details on how to do this.\r\n\r\n### Security\r\nThe build script automatically configures the system with **DNS recursion turned on**. This has security implications, since it potentially opens your DNS server to a DNS amplification attack, a kind of a [DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack). This should not be a concern however, as long as the `iptables` firewall rules configured automatically by the build script for you remain in place. However if you ever decide to turn the firewall off, please be aware of this.\r\n\r\nIf you want to turn DNS recursion off, please be aware that you will need a mechanism to selectively send DNS requests for domains your DNS server knows about (i.e. netflix.com) to your VPS and send all of the other DNS traffic to your local ISP's DNS server. Something like [Dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) can be used for this and some Internet routers even have it built in. In order to switch DNS recursion off, you will need to build your system using the following command:\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy /opt/netflix-proxy && cd /opt/netflix-proxy && ./build.sh -r 0 -b 1`\r\n\r\n### Command Line Options\r\nThe following command line options can be optionaly passed to `build.sh` for additional control:\r\n\r\n    Usage: ./build.sh [-r 0|1] [-b 0|1] [-c <ip>]\r\n        -r      enable (1) or disable (0) DNS recursion (default: 1)\r\n        -b      grab docker images from repository (0) or build locally (1) (default: 0)\r\n        -c      specify client-ip instead of being taken from ssh_connection[n3]\r\n\r\n## Other Cloud Providers\r\n\r\n[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/vultr.png)](http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6871746)\r\n\r\nThe following is based on a Debian image provided by `Vultr`, but should in theory work on any Debian distribution.\r\n\r\n1. Head over to [Vultr](http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6871746) to create an account.\r\n2. Create a compute instance using `Debian 8 x64 (jessie)` image.\r\n3. **Make sure to enable `IPv6` support**. \r\n4. Make sure you deploy the server in the right region, for example if you want to watch US content, create in one of the US DCs.\r\n5. SSH to your server and run: `apt-get update && apt-get -y install vim dnsutils curl sudo git && curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh && git clone https://github.com/ab77/netflix-proxy /opt/netflix-proxy && cd /opt/netflix-proxy && ./build.sh`\r\n6.

Probably a bit more complicated than it should be, but whatever :)\r\n\r\n0. First, please see note regarding [IPv6](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/faq/#) support.\r\n1. Then, if you are still interested, head over to [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/) and sign-up for an account.\r\n2. Get [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\r\n3. On your workstation, run `git clone https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness.git /opt/cloud-harness`.\r\n4. Follow `cloud-harness` [Installation and Configuration](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#installation-and-configuration) section to set it up.\r\n5. [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-storage-account-name-must-be-unique-as-it-forms-part-of-the-storage-url-check-with---action-check_storage_account_name_availability) a storage account.\r\n6. [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-a-new-hosted-service-name-must-be-unique-within-cloudappnet-domain-check-with---action-check_storage_account_name_availability) a new hosted service.\r\n7. [Add](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#add-x509-certificate-containing-rsa-public-key-for-ssh-authentication-to-the-hosted-service) a hosted service certificate for SSH public key authentication\r\n8. [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-a-reserved-ip-address-for-the-hosted-service) a reserved ip address.\r\n9. [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-virtual-network) a virtual network.\r\n10. [Create](http://docs.docker.com/engine/articles/https/) Docker certificates and update `[DockerExtension]` section in `cloud-harness.conf`.\r\n11. In `cloud-harness.conf` under `[DockerExtension]` section, set `docker_compose = netflix-proxy.yaml`.\r\n\r\nThen, [Create](https://github.com/ab77/cloud-harness#create-a-new-linux-virtual-machine-deployment-and-role-with-reserved-ip-ssh-authentication-and-customscript-resource-extensionn3) a `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS` virtual machine as follows:\r\n\r\n    ./cloud-harness.py azure --action create_virtual_machine_deployment \\\r\n    --service <your hosted service name> \\\r\n    --deployment <your hosted service name> \\\r\n    --name <your virtual machine name> \\\r\n    --label 'Netflix proxy' \\\r\n    --account <your storage account name> \\\r\n    --blob b39f27a8b8c64d52b05eac6a62ebad85__Ubuntu-14_04-LTS-amd64-server-20140414-en-us-30GB \\\r\n    --os Linux \\\r\n    --network VNet1 \\\r\n    --subnet Subnet-1 \\\r\n    --ipaddr <your reserved ipaddr name> \\\r\n    --size Medium \\\r\n    --ssh_auth \\\r\n    --disable_pwd_auth \\\r\n    --verbose\r\n\r\nNext, add the DockerExtension:\r\n\r\n    ./cloud-harness.py azure --action add_resource_extension \\\r\n    --service <your hosted service name> \\\r\n    --deployment <your hosted service name> \\\r\n    --name <your virtual machine name> \\\r\n    --extension DockerExtension \\\r\n    --docker_compose netflix-proxy.yaml \\\r\n    --verbose  \r\n\r\nSet `linux_customscript_name` under `[CustomScriptExtensionForLinux]` in `cloud-harness.conf` to `netflix-proxy.sh` and run:\r\n\r\n    ./cloud-harness.py azure --action add_resource_extension \\\r\n    --service netflix-proxy \\\r\n    --deployment netflix-proxy \\\r\n    --name netflix-proxy \\\r\n    --extension CustomScript \\\r\n    --verbose  \r\n\r\nOnce this part finishes, you should be able to SSH to your VM as `azureuser` using custom public TCP port (not `22`) and test the configuration by running:\r\n\r\n    dig netflix.com @localhost && echo \"GET /\" | openssl s_client -servername netflix.com -connect localhost:443\r\n\r\nLastly, use the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) to add `DNS (UDP)`, `HTTP (TCP)` and `HTTPS (TCP)` endpoints and secure them to your home/work/whatever IPs using the Azure `ACL` feature. This means you don't have to run `iptables` firewall on your VM.\r\n\r\nNow you are all set, set DNS server on your device(s) to your Azure public IP and enjoy `Netflix` and don't forget to turn off IPv6.\r\n\r\n### Automated Tests\r\n\r\nI've linked this project with `Travis CI` to automatically test the build. The helper Python script `__testbuild.py` now runs automatically after every commit. This script deploys a test `Droplet` and then runs a serious of tests to verify (a) that both `Docker` containers start; and (b) the `built.sh` script outputs the correct message at the end. The test `Droplet` is destroyed and the end of the run.\r\n\r\nThe `__testbuild.py` script can also be used to programatically deploy `Droplets` from the command line as follows:\r\n\r\n\tpython ./__testbuild.py digitalocean --api_token abcdef0123456789... --fingerprint 'aa:bb:cc:dd:...' --region 'abc1'\r\n\t\r\n* `--api_token abcdef0123456789...` is your `DigitalOCean` API v2 token, which you can generate [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/applications).\r\n* `--fingerprint aa:bb:cc:dd:...` are your personal SSH key fingerprint(s) quoted and separated by spaces. You can manage your SSH keys [here](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/settings/security). If you don't specify a fingerprint, it will default to my test one, which means you **won't** be able to SSH into your `Droplet`.\r\n* `--region abc1` is the region where you want the `Droplet` deployed. The default is `nyc3`, but you can use `--list_regions` to see the available choices.\r\n* `--help` parameter will also list all of the available command line options to pass to the script.\r\n\r\nNote, you will need a working `Python 2.7` environment and the modules listed in `requirements.txt` (run `pip install -r requirements.txt`).\r\n\r\n### IPv6\r\nThis solution uses IPv6 downstream from the proxy to unblock IPv6 enabled providers, such as Netflix. No IPv6 support on the client is required for this to work, only the VPS must have IPv6 support enabled:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+----------+                  +-----------+                 +-----------------+\r\n|          |                  |           |                 |                 |\r\n|  client  | +--------------> |   proxy   | +-------------> |  Netflix, etc.  |\r\n|          |      (ipv4)      |           |      (ipv6)     |                 |\r\n+----------+                  +-----------+                 +-----------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf IPv6 is not enabled, the VPS is built with IPv4 support only. You may need to turn off IPv6 on your local network (or relevant devices).[n6]\r\n\r\n### Further Work\r\nThis solution is meant to be a quick and dirty (but functional) method of bypassing geo-restrictions for various services. While it is (at least in theory) called a `smart DNS proxy`, the only `smart` bit is in the `zones.override` file, which tells the system which domains to proxy and which to pass through. You could easilly turn this into a `dumb/transparent DNS proxy`, by replacing the contents of `zones.override` with a simple[n4] statement:\r\n\r\n    zone \".\" {\r\n        type master;\r\n        file \"/data/db.override\";\r\n    };\r\n\r\nThis will in effect proxy every request that ends up on your VPS if you set your VPS IP as your main and only DNS server at home. This will unfortunately invalidate the original purpose of this project. Ideally, what you really want to do, is to have some form of DNS proxy at home, which selectively sends DNS requests to your VPS only for the domains you care about (i.e. netflix.com) and leaves everything else going out to your ISP DNS server(s). [Dnsmasq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq) could be used to achieve this, in combination, perhaps, with a small Linux device like Raspberry Pi or a router which can run OpenWRT.\r\n\r\nThere is a [similar](https://github.com/trick77/dockerflix) project to this, which automates the Dnsmasq configuration.\r\n\r\nIf your client is running OS X, you can skip dnsmasq and simply redirect all DNS requests for e.g. `netflix.com` to your VPS IP by creating a file at `/etc/resolver/netflix.com` with these contents:\r\n\r\n    nameserver xxx.yyy.zzz.ttt\r\n\r\nreplacing `xxx.yyy.zzz.ttt` with your VPS IP, of course.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nIf you have any idea, feel free to fork it and submit your changes back to me.\r\n\r\n### Donate\r\nIf you find this useful, please feel free to make a small donation with [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/belodetech) or Bitcoin.\r\n\r\n| Paypal | Bitcoin |\r\n| ------ | ------- |\r\n|<center>[![](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=5UUCDR8YXWERQ)</center>|<center>![91c446adbd54ef84eef1c6c1c723586aa0ba85d7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ab77/netflix-proxy/master/static/bitcoin_qr.png)<br />91c446adbd54ef84eef1c6c1c723586aa0ba85d7</center>|\r\n\r\n[![ab1](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2033996?v=3&s=96)](http://ab77.github.io/)\r\n\r\n#### Footnotes\r\n[n1] https://github.com/dlundquist/sniproxy by Dustin Lundquist dustin@null-ptr.net\r\n\r\n[n2] At the time of writing (May 2015), `Hulu` appears to be geo-restricted from `DigitalOcean` and `Linode` US IPs, but worked for a short time from a `DreamCompute` IAD DC IP.
